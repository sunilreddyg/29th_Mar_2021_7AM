Test Initiation
Test Plan
Test Design  ----[TestScenario, Test case , Test Data]
Test Execution

Entry Criteria for Test Execution:-->
	1. Unit and integration testing will be completed
	2. All testcase should be designed and approved
	3. Software installed into stagging servers


	TestBed:--> Combination of test environment and testcase is called TestBED


How they deploy software into test environment:-->

		=> After completed testcase reviews TestLead request software intallation
			at testing environment.
		=> That means Software installation into local servers [Stagging Server]
		=> Operational team deploy software into local servers and and request
		   network team to install all dependent softwares into testing evironment..
		=> Network team receive deployement document  [DD]

		What Deployment Document Contains:-->

			=> What are the hardware and softwares to install in testing environment
				for Example:-->  
						1. Operating system  [WIN10]
						2. Browser	     [IE11]
						3. RAM 		     [8 GB]
						4. Database          [SQL]

		=> Testing receive "Release note" from developement team
		=> What [Release note] or [Build note] contains:-->

				1. Document Version and approvals
						Release#1      [Build version and Names]
						Approved by ---[Name of the project manager]

				2. Hardwares and Softwares to install at Testing environment
						
						1. Operating system  [WIN10]
						2. Browser	     [IE11]
					Note:--> Here testing team need to verify all neccessary
						hardwares and software installed before execution.

				3. Site url or Local IP address
						http://192.168.1.23/OSM/Admin
			
				4. Authentication details 
			
						Site usernames and Password
=================================================================================================>>
TestExecution:-->

		After completed software deployment process into testing environment. Testing team
		follow below levels of execution.

		Level-0 :--> Smoke Testing
		Level-1 :--> Comprehesive testing 
		Level-2 :--> Sanity Testing
		Level-3 :--> ReTesting
		Level-4 :--> Regression Testing
		Level-5 :--> Final regression testing


SmokeTesting:-->

		Smoke testing is a level-0 testing. Testing team conduct smoke testing
		on every initial software. The main agenda of smoke testing is to find
		stability of software.

		=> During smoke testing  testing team verify all important functionalites
		   working and are they any "showstopper" defects available in software build.

		=> Incase testing team findout any showStopper [High seviority  defects]
		   immedietly testing suspend build and request new build to install in a testing
		   environment..

		=> Other name of smoke testing is "build verification testing"

Comprehensive Testing:-->
		=> comprehensive is level-1 testing ,Also knows as real testing
		=> During this test testing team execute every testcase on Real Software.
		=> In this level testing team report defects to developement team incase
		   any mismatch find out in software while execution fo testcase.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		
		TestSteps       ||     Expected Result       	||    Actual Result        ||     Status
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Enter url at IE browser       ||   should display homepage 	||  Homepage is displayed  ||     TestPASS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Cilck on Singin button        || should display Signup page  	||  Sigup not displayed    ||     TestFail
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Execution steps:-->

	1. Pick a Testcase  
	2. Read and Understand testcase
	3. Operate software and perform test steps according to testcase
	4. check actual result at real software, Then write acutal result at testcase document
	5. If actual result match with expected result It mean test pass, when testpass we should write
			Testpass status with testcase document and continue testexecution for next testcase.
	6. If actual result mismatch with expected result we should change testcase status from NO-RUN to 
			Testfail and report defect to developement team. 
			Defect reporting tools --->[JIRA,QUALITYCENTER,Bugzilla ---etc]
	7. Find dependent testcases for failure testcase, And change execution status from NO-RUN to NOT-COVERED
	8. Continue execution for next testcase


The following activities should be taken care:
	1. Number of test cases executed.
	2. Number of defects found
	3. Screen shots of successful and failure executions should be taken in word document.
	4. Time taken to execute.
	5. Time wasted due to the unavailability of the system.


	Note:--> During comprehensive testing testing team report defects to developement team. And	
		developent team fix those defects and release new version of sofware to testing team
		for further testing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>>
Sanity Testing:-->
		Sanity testing also a build verification testing but santity testing conducts on modified
		sofwares.

		=> During sanity testing testing team verify application stability after code modified
		   from developement team.
		
=======================================================================================================
Retesting:-->
	
	To Ensure that the defecs which we reported in previous build were fixed or not in current build.

		For Example:-->
				=>Say build  Build#1.0 was released and we posted some defects to developement team
				=>developement team fix those defects and release new version of software  Build#1.1 to testing team
				=> Testing Build#1.0 defects in Build#1.1
======================================================================================================
Regression Testing:-->
		
		Repeating all failed and some of passed testcase on modified software. Here is the
		assumption when software modified to fix bugs it may effect to existing software and 
		their is chance of new defects invention.

		=> Regression testing continues until all defects has been fixed


		 Theroy:-->When your are introducing something to software, 
					It means your are inveting new defects init.


		when we do regression testing:-->
			1. Any new requirement added to software
			2. Any changes in requirements  
			3. When Defects fix in exising software
			4. when browser version is upgraded
			5. When changes made in Databse
			6. When Perform testing bugs fixed


		The following activies should be take care?.
			1. Un-covered testcase executon in previous build
			2. Testcase while is not coverd due to unavailability of environment


		Note:--> Becuase regression testing is time taking due to this reason testing 
			 team follow automation tools to perform regression repeatedly.
				
				Regression tools available in market:-->
					1. Selenium
					2. UFT
					3. RFT
					4. CodedUI
					5. Protractor
					6. Katalon Stuido    ---etc
