Non-Functional Testing:-->

	=> Tester involve in non-functional testing using NFRS document
		[Non functional required specification document].

	=> After completed functional testing  testing involve in non functional
		testings, These non-functional are support functional are to perform better.


1.Usability Testing:-->
	During this test tester verify user friendlyness of software

	Note:--> Tester verify software userfriendlyness using below checklist

	1.Verify spelling in all screens of software
	2.Verify labels in it all screens of software
	3.Verify Meaning of labels in all screens of software
	4.Verify line spacing in label and control
	5.Verify line spacing in controls
	6.Verify location of controls which are functionality related
	7.Verify home button in every screens
	8.Verify shortcuts in labels of screens
	9.Verify icon symbol meaning
	10.Verify icon tool tips
	11.Verify  keyboard access on every screens
	12.Verify meaning of error
	13.Verify system menu existence in screens.(Minimize, Maximize, Restore, click….etc
	14.Verify help documentations.
	15.Verify color contrast of screens

===================================================================
2. Compatibily Testing:-->
	During this test tester verify browser and operating system comptibility.
	Here test engineer verify whether software is accessable and operatable 
	with in client expected browsers and operating systems.

	=> Other name of compatibility testing is cross browser testing
		[In real time organizations use selenium kind of automation tools to 
			conduct cross -browser automation]	

	Difficulties:-->
		=> if develope fix bug in one browser it effect to other browsers. Because
			each browser follow differnt domain polocies
	
		=> manually testing in differnet browsers it is take taking process.

======================================================================
3.Performance testing
	=> Performance is non functional testing 
	=> Performance testing only possible using automation tool like [LoadRunner, Jmeter]
	=> During this test performance testing engineers verify software speed  and response
		under customer expected configuration

	Performance testing can be conducted using below sub tests..
			1. Load Testing
			2. Stress Testing
			3. Spike Testing
			4. Endurance Testing

Loadtesting: 
	the execution of software under customer configaration and cutomer
	expected load(No of concurrent users) to estimate speed in processing, is called
	load testing

Stress testing:
	the execution of software under customer expected configaration and more 
	than customer expected load to estimate "peak load" is called stress testing

spike testing:
	the execution of software under cutomer configaration and more than
	customer expected load to estimate relability.
	=>During this test tester add no of concurrent user suddenly and verify
	    speed in processing

Endurance testing:
	execution of software under cutomer configaration and more than
	customer expected load continously to estimate logvity and durability is called
	endurance testing
=========================================================================
Datavolume testing:
	During this test, testing team is operating software by storing sample 
	data to estimate capacity of the software database.

	Depends on technology, database capacities are changing due to this
	reason testing team conduct data volume testing to find the capacity of database
	in number of records.
========================================================================
Intersystem testing:-->
	During this test, testing team verify our software is sharing data and co-existing
	with other softwares.

		Example:--> Flipkart use different payment gateways to make payement.
				=> VISA
				=> Master
				=> American Express
=========================================================================
Installation Testing:-->
	=> Installation testing conduct most commonly on Desktop softwares
	=> To conduct installation testing tester follow below steps 

	1.Verify set up program execute to start installation
	2.Verify friendliness of screens while installation
	3.Verify occupied space after installation
	4.Verify Un install process 
	5.Verify user can cancel installation any time.
	6.Verify installation asking accept license agreement.
	7.Verify user able to watch installation screens.
=======================================================================
Recovery Testing:-->

	Recovery testing is performed in order to determine how quickly the system can
	recover after the system crash or hardware failure. 
	It comes under the type of nonfunctional testing.
==========================================================================
. Globalization Testing.
	Globalization is a process of designing a software application so that 
	it can be adapted to various languages and regions without any changes.

		Example:-->
			Amazon website can across the world with
			differnet price tags.
			
			India --> http://amazon.in
			UK    --> http://amazon.uk
			USA   --> http://amazon.com

===========================================================================
Localization Testing (L10N Testing):
	Localization is a process of adapting globalization software for a specific 
	region orlanguage by adding local specific components.

	1. Verify software available in local language
	2. Verify local timezones are displaying
	3. Verify Local maps displaying at software

	Multy languity testing:
	some times developers are developing a s\w in java unicode or .net with
	unicode. This type  of sofware provide output in differnt lanaguge and by
	taking input in one language.
